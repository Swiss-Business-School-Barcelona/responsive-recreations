      question: "I can't code. Can I still join?",
      answer: "You don't need any coding experience. This bootcamp is built for non-technical folks who want to launch real apps using AI tools."
    },
    {
      question: "What kind of app can I really build in 6 weeks?",
      answer: "You'll build a working digital product with real functionality, not just a prototype. What it does depends on your idea."
    },
    {
      question: "How much time should I put in each week?",
      answer: "Plan for around 8 to 10 hours per week. It's flexible, but the more you commit, the more you'll get out of it."
    },
    {
      question: "What happens after the program ends?",
      answer: "You'll leave with a working product, and a roadmap to grow it. We also help you plan your next steps if you want to keep building."
    },
    {
      question: "What if I don't have an idea?",
      answer: "That's fine. We'll work as a team to brainstorm and choose an idea together."
    },
    {
      question: "Which idea will we develop a product for?",
      answer: "In the first class, everyone will share their ideas. As a group, we'll review them and choose the most promising one to develop together. That idea will become our focus for the entire bootcamp."
    },
    {
      question: "How do these AI tools actually work?",
      answer: "We'll show you how to use no-code platforms powered by AI. They're beginner-friendly and designed to help you build fast."
    },
    {
      question: "I'm not a tech person. Is that okay?",
      answer: "Totally. This bootcamp is designed for creative thinkers, not just techies. If you can use a computer, you'll do just fine."
    },
    {
      question: "What if this just isn't right for me?",
      answer: "If after the first week you feel like it's not a fit, you can leave with no hard feelings. No pressure to continue."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I know if this is a good fit?",
      answer: "If you've got an idea and want to turn it into something real, without code, this is built exactly for you."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I apply, and is space limited?",
      answer: "Yes, space is limited. Just fill out the short application and we'll get back to you quickly."
    },
    {
      question: "Where do we meet?",
      answer: "It's an in-person program held in Barcelona, at a bright and inspiring co-working space in the city center."
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need to buy any AI tools myself?",
      answer: "Nope. We'll provide access to everything you need during the program."
